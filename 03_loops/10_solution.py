## Exponential Backoff
## Problem: Implement an exponential backoff strategy that doubles the wait time between retries, starting from 1 second, but stops after 5 retries

import time

wait_time = 1
max_retries = 5
attempts = 0

while attempts <= max_retries:
    print("Attempts:", attempts+1, "- Wait time:", wait_time)
    time.sleep(wait_time)
    wait_time *= 2
    attempts += 1
